description: Let the blogging begin
---

Athough I've been dabbling with technology for quite sometime, I'd always shy away from sharing my thoughts on an open platform such as a blog. While I had no hesitation and infact found it extremely helpful to participate on online discussion forums, a blog seemed much more personal. It has the power to be the front and center of our online identity.

Reading through several excellent blogs, I realize it's not about mastery or being an expert on a subject that gates being a good blogger. Of course, having an intimate knowledge on what we write helps. But, more important is communicating to the reading audience in a lucid style -- taking even the simplest of ideas, techniques, experiences, or opinions and expressing them in a clear useful way.

With that in mind, I've decided to take the plunge, start a blog and share my thoughts on topics that catch my curiosity. No guarantees that my writing will be of use to anyone at all. But I hope it does :)
